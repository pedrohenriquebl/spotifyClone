## Resume;

I started this project after beeing working with Magento2 and before that, studied a little bit of oop with PHP, so I was affraid of not perform so well with front-end basics.

I struggled a little bit after built the whole menu on hard mode, but then I remembered about the magic of flexbox which helped me to build it fastly.

The hardest part of the code was the third, which gave me some headache to align the content.

Took me almost 2 days and half to finish it and there are a lot of improvement to be made, mainly become it responsive, but I'll come back another time in the future to fix it.

Thanks.
